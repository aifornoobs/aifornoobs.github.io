# What do we do here?
AI is indeed a fast moving field. A state-of-the-art model this year becomes obselete the next year. And the only way to keep up is to follow various researcher's work. If you have just entered this field and tried to read a paper, you would feel little uncomfortable due to various reasons.

This is an attempt to bridge this gap by explaing the concepts in the most simple way by giving various examples. Then we'll start the math behind the concept. No, you are not allowed to skip the math. It's important. Everywhere.

And this is something I wished for when I started out reading papers and understanding concepts. Coz y'all know how scientific papers are written... ;)
