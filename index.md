This blog focuses on explaining the concepts of AI using simple analogous examples. 

AI is fast moving field. And the only way to keep up is to follow various researcher's work. For a person who has entered this field, they would feel like they got hit by a bus. 

This is an attempt to bridge that gap and give them a jump start to this beautiful yet scary world of AI. This is what I wished for when I started out reading papers and understanding concepts. 

Coz y'all know how scientific papers are written... ;)
