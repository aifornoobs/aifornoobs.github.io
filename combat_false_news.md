# How can artificial intelligence be used to combat false news reports?

Any AI needs data and an algorithm to analyze and predict about anything. Neural networks are amazing in finding correlations among the data. But, news can be about anything and analyzing, understanding and judging the same becomes a difficult task. In fact, this situation falls in the lines of “general intelligence” which is still under research.

Till then, a simple and yet effective way would work by analyzing the problem’s root. When a news source publishes a fake article, they only think about the ratings and likes and shares. Because, if you consider a legit news source, they would do enough background research before publishing it. And this doesn’t matter to the fake sources until they are getting what they want. So, this is where we need to grab em. This is what I propose:

Now, every news has to fade away from lime-light. And when that happens, public will be knowing whether that news was real or fake. Now if an algorithm is developed which takes simple crowd-sourced feedback of a news article which rates the source of this news article, the sources will become careful on what they are publishing.

So, you might ask where is the AI part in it? Well, the input provided by the public has different distributions in terms of the age, location, profession, etc. Using this information, the algorithm can give more weight to those set of users to which the article belongs to. Eg : If there is a tech news article, to judge whether its real or fake, the feedback of those users in the tech industry will be given more weight. Basically, this is an optimization problem. Maybe, a neural network can be deployed on this side of the AI until general intelligence picks up. Public will be now knowing the true colors of this source.

Now, if you are a news source and want to maintain your fame, you will think twice before announcing something because you don’t want to lose your credibility.

There are few debatable aspects in this. I agree. Starting with…
1. How is the feedback taken from users? Maybe incorporate a “Real or Fake” poll in between the FB and twitter feeds.
2. What if a mafia altogether kicks off for defaming a credible source taking supari. That’s just like bot-net attack. Do exactly what we do to avoid botnets.

The take away point here is, if a user doesn’t want fake news to be delivered to them, well, you need to put in an effort for that to happen. All this while, we have taken technology for granted. It might not be the case in AI because the data is the foundation for any AI to effectively serve its purpose.
